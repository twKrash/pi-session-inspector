# Changelog

All notable changes will follow [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/) and [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- Current-session full-screen TUI with fixed analytics tabs, active/tree scope selection, narrow-terminal layout, and lazy Ledger materialization.

### Changed

- Deferred history UI selection and drill-down to the next web UI milestone; the current TUI intentionally covers only the current session.

## [0.1.0]

### Added

- M3 checkpoint, recovery, maintenance lease, and manifest-only history support.
- Per-writer WAL lifecycle timing with clock-rollback-safe recovery.

### Changed

- Released the approved v1 product, research, architecture, and implementation baseline.

## Versioning policy

Before `1.0.0`, a minor release may change public or persisted schemas only with migration support, fixture proof, and a migration note. Security/privacy and data-loss fixes may ship patch releases.
